    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hurry Up Tomorrow is The Weeknd's 6th studio album and the final album in his latest trilogy, following his previous albums After Hours and Dawn FM. It also serves as the final album released under his current alias, before most likely moving on to release music under his real name, Abel Tesfaye, <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/culture/the-weeknd-lily-rose-depp-the-idol-hbo-interview">according to this interview</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      The album has various features from artists such as Playboi Carti (Timeless), Anitta (São Paulo), and Future (Enjoy The Show, Given Up On Me), and production, mainly handled by The Weeknd and Mike Dean, features contributions from Metro Boomin, Oneohtrix Point Never, and many more.
    </p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>Biggest song: Timeless</p>
    <p>Smallest song: Without a Warning</p>
    <p>Most Favorite song: Cry For Me</p>
    <p>Least favorite song: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
    <p>Honorable mention: Niagara Falls</p>
    <p>Best moment: Given Up On Me intro</p>
    <p>Most underrated song: Niagara Falls</p>
    <p>Most overrated song: Timeless</p>
    <p>Best beat: Cry For Me</p>
    <p>Best feature: Future (Enjoy The Show)</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Despite not being a long-time fan of The Weeknd, I feel like this album is the perfect sendoff to his longtime fans who have been following him since his earlier projects such as Kiss Land or Beauty Behind The Madness, or even his original mixtape trilogy, as he finally puts to rest his alter-ego and moves on to bigger projects, making sure to give them one last proper goodbye, making various aknowledgements about his legacy and even about his most personal moments, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAM_WuDFrTI">his voice crack</a> that led him to cancel his LA show, which has been referenced in I Can't Fucking Sing. The production on this album was also very phenomenal, featuring in my opinion some of Metro Boomin's best beats, and many of the features, such as Future's in Enjoy The Show, completely complimented the songs quite well. <br><br> I look forward to see what else Abel Tesfaye has in store for his many fans, and I hope he will keep on delivering like he always did. <br><br> May The Weekend's legacy live on for years to come.</p>
    <h1>FINAL RATING: <br> 4/5</h1>
