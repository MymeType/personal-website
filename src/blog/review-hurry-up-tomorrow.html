    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Hurry Up Tomorrow is The Weeknd's 6th studio album and the final album in
      his latest trilogy, following his previous albums After Hours and Dawn FM.
      It also serves as the final album released under his current alias, before
      most likely moving on to release music under his real name, Abel Tesfaye,

      >
        according to this interview</a
      >.
      <br />
      <br />
      The album has various features from artists such as Playboi Carti
      (Timeless), Anitta (São Paulo), and Future (Enjoy The Show, Given Up On
      Me), and production, mainly handled by The Weeknd and Mike Dean, features
      contributions from Metro Boomin, Oneohtrix Point Never, and many more.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Despite not being a long-time fan of The Weeknd, I feel like this album is
      the perfect sendoff to his longtime fans who have been following him since
      his earlier projects such as Kiss Land or Beauty Behind The Madness, or
      even his original mixtape trilogy, as he finally puts to rest his
      alter-ego and moves on to bigger projects, making sure to give them one
      last proper goodbye, making various aknowledgements about his legacy and
      even about his most personal moments, such as
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAM_WuDFrTI">
        his voice crack
      </a>
      that led him to cancel his LA show, which has been referenced in I Can't
      Fucking Sing. The production on this album was also very phenomenal,
      featuring in my opinion some of Metro Boomin's best beats, and many of the
      features, such as Future's in Enjoy The Show, completely complimented the
      songs quite well.
      <br />
      <br />
      I look forward to see what else Abel Tesfaye has in store for his many
      fans, and I hope he will keep on delivering like he always did.
      <br />
      <br />
      May The Weekend's legacy live on for years to come.
